[Apache APISIX](https://api7.ai/apisix) is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance API Gateway.

Originally created by [API7.ai](https://api7.ai), APISIX was open-sourced and donated to Apache Software Foundation in 2019, making the vision of serving half of the world's API requests possible.

APISIX has hundreds of built-in features and nearly a hundred plug-ins, which can help developers quickly and safely process requests from APIs and microservices. If you are looking for an open-source, cloud-native API gateway for load balancing, dynamic upstream, canary release, circuit breaking, authentication, and observability, APISIX is worth a look.
