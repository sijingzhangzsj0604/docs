API7 has more than 60 built-in common plugins, covering authentication, security protection, traffic control, analysis and monitoring, request/response conversion and many other categories. Some popular plugins are listed in the chart below.

## Authentication

Authentication plugin can effectively protect Route, Service from illegal, unprivileged access.

|      Name      |                                                                                                        Description                                                                                                        |

| authz-keycloak |                                              When the plugin is enabled, API7 will support working with KeyCloak authentication service to complete identity authentication.                                              |
|   basic-auth   |                                                           When the plugin is enabled, the client needs to use the correct account and password when accessing.                                                            |
|   hmac-auth    | When the plugin is enabled, in addition to verifying the validity of the client's identity, its end request parameters will also be signed and verified to avoid parameter tampering or secondary access (replay attack). |
|    jwt-auth    |                    When the plugin is enabled, JSON Web Token will be used for validity verification, and the client needs to add the correct Token content to the HTTP request header when accessing.                    |
|    key-auth    |                                         When the plugin is enabled, the client needs to carry the correct key in the request header or query string when accessing the resource.                                          |
|   wolf-rbac    |                                                         With this plugin enabled, the gateway will support wolf-based authentication and authorization features.                                                          |

|   ldap-auth    |                                    The built-in authentication plugin can be integrated with the LDAP service and cooperate with the Consumer to realize the authentication function.                                     |
|      opa       |               This plugin is used to integrate with Open Policy Agent. Using this plugin, users can decouple authentication and authorization functions, reducing the complexity of the application system.               |
|  forward-auth  |                                   The plugin uses classic external authentication. When the certification fails, you can implement custom errors or redirect to the certification page.                                   |

|  request-validation  |                                   When the gateway forwards the request upstream, the plugin uses JSONSchema to validate the request header against the request body, and requests that fail the validation are rejected.                                    |
|     uri-blocker      |                                                                 When the plugin is enabled, the gateway will return the specified status code when the request path matches the preset rule.                                                                 |

|     proxy-cache     | The plugin will support caching upstream service response content, when the content requested by the client already exists in the cache, the content will be returned directly from the cache, without the need to request the upstream service again. This will effectively reduce the pressure on the upstream service. In addition, when the upstream node fails, it can also temporarily return the cached content without returning the error page to improve the user experience. |
