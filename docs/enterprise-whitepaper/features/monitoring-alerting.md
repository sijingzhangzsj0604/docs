API7 records the basic information and status of each request. With the help of the statistical report page in the dashboard control panel, administrators can see the status of each service call, status code distribution, number of successes, number of failures, top 95 values, top 99 values and other information. It is convenient for administrators to understand the health of the system. In addition, the data plane will regularly report the traffic processing situation, and the administrator can view the gateway operation status and other indicators, such as error rate, number of requests, status code distribution, etc., within a certain time period through the control panel. When the administrator presets the alarm rules through the control panel, if the traffic reported by the gateway matches the rules, it will trigger the preset policies, such as sending station letters, email alerts, SMS and Webhook notifications, etc.
