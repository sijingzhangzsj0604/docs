API7 has a built-in log auditing module, which collects system security events, administrator operation records, system operation logs, system operation status and other kinds of information in the information system centrally, and then stores and manages them centrally in the form of logs in a unified format after normalization, filtering and consolidation, combining with rich log statistical summary and correlation analysis functions to realize comprehensive auditing of information system logs. Through post-event analysis and reporting system, administrators can easily and efficiently conduct targeted security audits on information systems; when encountering special security events or configuration failures, the log auditing system can help administrators conduct rapid configuration positioning and rollback. Only administrators with authority can perform operation rollback.
