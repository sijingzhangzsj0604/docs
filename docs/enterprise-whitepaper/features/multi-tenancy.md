API7 has a built-in workspace module, super administrators need to create multiple workspaces, then create ordinary users and assign different permissions (in the configuration of permissions, you can bind workspace and resource permissions), so that the combination of the user system and permission management can achieve different users in different workspaces, different permissions for different resources, in order to achieve fine-grained control of resources permissions.
