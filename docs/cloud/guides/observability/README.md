Currently, API7 Cloud collects metrics from gateway instances and visualizes them
on the console. You can see diagrams on the [monitoring page](../product/how-to-monitor-your-data-plane-instances.md).
In addition, API7 Cloud also supports gateway instances' logs via logger plugins. There are a lot of original Apache APISIX
logger plugins and a logging plugin made by API7 Cloud. You can use the logging plugin by learning the docs below:

* [Log Collection with HTTP Logger](./log-collection-with-http-logger.md)
* [Log Collection with Kafka Logger](./log-collection-with-kafka-logger.md)
