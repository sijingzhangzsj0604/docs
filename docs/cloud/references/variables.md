API7 Cloud supports configuring variables in some cases, like a consistent hash key and log format. Variables
are used as interpolation and will be replaced with the actual value with the API request runtime.

API7 Cloud supports variables provided by [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) and [Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/).
Refer to the below materials for the variable definitions.

* [Nginx Variables](http://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html)
* [Apache APISIX Variables](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/apisix-variable/)
