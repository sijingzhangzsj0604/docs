You'll begin your API7 Cloud journey, especially by learning the steps to manage your very own APIs.

Your journey will be:

1. Create an account and login to API7 Cloud;
2. Add a gateway instance and connect it to the API7 Cloud;
3. Create the HTTPBIN Application;
4. Create API for the HTTPBIN Application;
5. Use [curl](https://curl.se/) to test if the API is working;
6. Attach the [Limit Count Plugin](../guides/traffic-management/limit-count.md) to the API;
7. Summary.

Are you ready? Here we go!
