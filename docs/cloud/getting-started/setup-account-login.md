After you log in successfully, API7 Cloud will redirect you to the console.
You may see "Please wait for a while. Your service is being deployed" when
you're on the overview page. Kindly wait for a while, and API7 Cloud will
complete the provision soon if this happens.

Note if this is your first time signing in to the console, API7 Cloud will ask you to input the organization name.
