Now we have created the HTTPBIN Service successfully, specifying the upstream URL. But we don't have any API endpoints.

In this section, we'll create an API endpoint that returns a JSON string from https://httpbin.org.

Enter the HTTPBIN Service detail page, and click on the **Create API** button.

API7 Cloud will open a popup window, filling in the API details.

Click on the **Create** button, API7 Cloud will create the API.

Now you have created the JSON API. Some contents you should know are:

1. We set the API "Path" to `/json`, and we click the "Strip Path Prefix" option, which means the `/v1/json` will be rewritten to "/json" before proxying to the backend;
2. Only the `GET` method is allowed;

Congratulations! You have created the JSON API. Now, let's send some requests to verify if it works!
